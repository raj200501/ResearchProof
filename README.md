# ResearchProof

**ResearchProof** is an Idris-based tool for verifying mathematical proofs in academic research papers. The application allows researchers to input their mathematical proofs, and it uses Idris's dependent type system to ensure the correctness of these proofs.

## Features

- Verifies mathematical proofs using Idris's dependent type system
- Provides examples of verified proofs
- Includes a testing framework for proof verification

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/ResearchProof.git
    cd ResearchProof
    ```

2. Build the project:
    ```bash
    ./build/build.sh
    ```

## Usage

1. Run the application:
    ```bash
    idris --exec main src/Main.idr
    ```

2. Input your mathematical proofs for verification.
